## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to initialize and execute the YouTube Bulk Upload CLI tool, which facilitates the bulk uploading of video files to YouTube with customizable metadata and options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
Â· None: The `main` function does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it parses command-line arguments using `argparse`.

**Code Description**: The `main` function serves as the entry point for the YouTube Bulk Upload CLI tool. It begins by setting up logging to ensure that all actions and errors are properly recorded. The logging configuration includes a custom format that includes timestamps, log levels, module names, and messages, making it easier to debug and track the tool's execution.

The function retrieves the package version using `pkg_resources` and defines a description for the CLI tool. It then initializes an `argparse.ArgumentParser` object to handle command-line arguments. The arguments are grouped into three categories: General Options, YouTube Options, and Thumbnail Options.

General Options include settings such as logging level, dry-run mode, source directory, file extensions, non-interactive mode, and upload batch limit. These options allow users to control the behavior of the tool, such as enabling dry-run mode to simulate uploads without actually uploading videos, or specifying the directory from which video files should be sourced.

YouTube Options allow users to configure YouTube-specific settings, such as the path to the client secrets file, category ID, keywords, description template file, and title/description replacements. These options enable users to customize the metadata associated with the uploaded videos, such as titles, descriptions, and keywords.

Thumbnail Options provide settings for customizing thumbnail filenames, including prefixes, suffixes, and replacements. Users can specify the file extensions for thumbnails, ensuring that the tool correctly identifies and associates thumbnail images with the corresponding video files.

After parsing the command-line arguments, the function sets the logging level based on the provided `log_level` argument. It then initializes an instance of the `YouTubeBulkUpload` class, passing all the parsed arguments as parameters. This class handles the actual bulk upload process, including file discovery, metadata generation, and upload execution.

The `main` function calls the `process` method of the `YouTubeBulkUpload` instance to begin the upload process. If any errors occur during the upload, they are logged, and the function raises the exception to halt execution. Upon successful completion, the function logs the number of videos uploaded and their details, including input filenames, YouTube titles, and URLs.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the YouTube client secrets file is correctly configured and accessible, as it is required for authentication with the YouTube API.
- Use the `--dry_run` option to test the tool without performing actual uploads, which is useful for verifying configurations and metadata.
- The `--noninteractive` option can be used to disable interactive prompts, allowing for fully automated operation. However, this may result in skipped uploads if issues arise that require user input.
- Be mindful of YouTube's daily upload limits when using the `--upload_batch_limit` option to avoid exceeding the allowed number of uploads in a 24-hour period.
