### FunctionDef __init__(self, gui_root, logger, bundle_dir, running_in_pyinstaller)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI class, setting up the graphical user interface (GUI) and configuring various variables and components required for the application.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· gui_root: A `tk.Tk` object representing the root window of the GUI.
· logger: A `logging.Logger` object used for logging messages within the application.
· bundle_dir: A `Path` object specifying the directory where the application's resources are located.
· running_in_pyinstaller: A boolean flag indicating whether the application is running in a PyInstaller bundle.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class. It initializes the GUI and sets up the necessary components for the YouTube Bulk Uploader application. The method begins by assigning the provided `logger` to an instance variable and logging a debug message indicating the start of the initialization process. The `gui_root`, `bundle_dir`, and `running_in_pyinstaller` parameters are also stored as instance variables for later use.

The method then defines and initializes several variables that will be used to store user inputs and settings. These include:
- `log_level` and `log_level_var`: Used to manage the logging level of the application. The `log_level_var` is a `tk.StringVar` that tracks changes to the log level and triggers the `on_log_level_change` method when updated.
- `upload_thread` and `stop_event`: Used to manage the upload process. The `stop_event` is a `threading.Event` that signals the upload thread to stop.
- Various `tk.StringVar`, `tk.BooleanVar`, and `tk.IntVar` variables: These store user inputs such as the source directory, YouTube client secrets file, upload batch limit, file extensions, YouTube category ID, keywords, description template file, title prefixes/suffixes, thumbnail file prefixes/suffixes, privacy status, and other settings.

The method also sets up a protocol to handle the window close event, ensuring that the `on_closing` method is called when the user attempts to close the window. This method is responsible for saving the GUI configuration and stopping any ongoing upload threads.

Next, the method calls `set_window_icon` to set the application window icon to the YouTube Bulk Upload logo. It then calls `create_gui_frames_widgets` to set up the GUI frames and widgets, organizing them into a grid layout and adding buttons, progress bars, and log output sections.

The method also adds a custom log handler to the logger using `add_textbox_log_handler`, which directs log messages to a text widget in the GUI. This allows users to view log messages in real-time within the application.

After updating the GUI to reflect the latest changes, the method calculates the minimum size of the window to ensure it is not resized smaller than its initial dimensions. It then loads user configuration options from a JSON file using `load_gui_config_options`, applying any saved settings to the GUI variables.

Finally, the method calls `show_welcome_popup` to display a welcome message to the user, providing an introduction to the application and its features. The method concludes by logging an informational message indicating that the initialization process is complete.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `gui_root`, `logger`, `bundle_dir`, and `running_in_pyinstaller` parameters are correctly provided when initializing the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class.
- The `__init__` method sets up the foundation for the GUI and its functionality, so any changes to the initialization process should be carefully coordinated with the rest of the application.
- The method relies on several other methods (`set_window_icon`, `create_gui_frames_widgets`, `add_textbox_log_handler`, `load_gui_config_options`, and `show_welcome_popup`) to fully configure the GUI. Ensure these methods are correctly implemented and integrated.

### FunctionDef show_welcome_popup(self)
**show_welcome_popup**: The function of show_welcome_popup is to display a welcome message popup window when the application is launched, providing users with an introduction to the YouTube Bulk Uploader tool and its features.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `show_welcome_popup` function is responsible for creating and displaying a welcome message popup window when the YouTube Bulk Uploader application is initialized. The popup window is only shown if the user has not opted out of seeing the welcome message, as determined by the `dont_show_welcome_message_var` variable.

The function begins by checking the value of `dont_show_welcome_message_var`. If the user has previously selected the option to not show the welcome message again, the function exits immediately without displaying the popup. Otherwise, a new `Toplevel` window is created as a child of the main application window (`gui_root`), and its title is set to "Welcome to YouTube Bulk Uploader".

The welcome message is a multi-line string that provides an overview of the tool's functionality, including instructions on how to obtain a YouTube Data API Client Secret, how to use the tool to upload videos in bulk, and tips for testing the tool with the "Dry Run" feature. The message also explains the use of regular expressions for find/replace patterns in video titles, thumbnail filenames, and YouTube descriptions. Additionally, it encourages users to watch a tutorial video by clicking the "Watch Tutorial" button.

The message is displayed in a `Label` widget within the popup window, with text wrapping set to 600 pixels and left justification. Below the message, a `Checkbutton` widget allows users to opt out of seeing the welcome message again in the future. This checkbox is linked to the `dont_show_welcome_message_var` variable, which persists the user's preference.

The popup window also includes two buttons: "Watch Tutorial" and "Close". The "Watch Tutorial" button calls the `open_link` function, passing the URL of the tutorial video as an argument. The "Close" button simply destroys the popup window, closing it.

After creating the widgets, the function calculates the size of the popup window and positions it in the center of the main application window. This ensures that the popup is visually centered and easy for the user to interact with.

The `show_welcome_popup` function is called during the initialization of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class, specifically in the `__init__` method. This ensures that the welcome message is displayed to the user as soon as the application starts, providing them with essential information and guidance on how to use the tool effectively.

**Note**: The welcome popup is designed to be user-friendly and informative, but it can be disabled by the user if they prefer not to see it again. The `dont_show_welcome_message_var` variable is used to store this preference, ensuring that the popup is not shown unnecessarily.

**Output Example**: The function does not return any value. Instead, it creates and displays a popup window with the welcome message, a "Don't show this message again" checkbox, and two buttons ("Watch Tutorial" and "Close"). The popup window is centered relative to the main application window.

### FunctionDef open_link(self, url)
**open_link**: The function of open_link is to open a specified URL in the default web browser.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· url: A string representing the URL to be opened in the web browser.

**Code Description**: The `open_link` function is a utility method designed to open a given URL in the user's default web browser. It achieves this by utilizing the `webbrowser` module, which is part of Python's standard library. The function takes a single parameter, `url`, which is passed to the `webbrowser.open()` method. This method automatically launches the default web browser and navigates to the specified URL.

In the context of the project, this function is called by the `show_welcome_popup` method within the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class. Specifically, it is used to open a tutorial video link when the user clicks the "Watch Tutorial" button in the welcome popup window. The URL passed to `open_link` in this case is "https://youtu.be/9WklrdupZhg", which directs the user to a YouTube tutorial video. This integration ensures that users can easily access additional guidance on how to use the YouTube Bulk Uploader tool.

**Note**: Ensure that the URL provided is valid and accessible. The function relies on the system's default web browser, so its behavior may vary depending on the user's browser settings. Additionally, the function does not handle any errors that may occur if the URL is invalid or if the browser fails to open.
***
### FunctionDef load_gui_config_options(self)
**load_gui_config_options**: The function of load_gui_config_options is to load and apply GUI configuration options from a JSON configuration file to the YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI application.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: Refers to the instance of the YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI class, allowing access to its attributes and methods.

**Code Description**: The `load_gui_config_options` function is responsible for reading a JSON configuration file located at `self.gui_config_filepath` and applying the stored settings to the corresponding GUI variables in the YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI application. The function begins by logging the attempt to load the configuration file. It then opens the file in read mode and uses the `json.load` method to parse the JSON content into a Python dictionary.

The function iterates through the dictionary and assigns values to various GUI-related variables, such as `log_level_var`, `dry_run_var`, `noninteractive_var`, `source_directory_var`, and others. These variables control different aspects of the GUI, including logging levels, source directory paths, YouTube client secrets, upload batch limits, file extensions, and privacy statuses. Default values are provided for each variable in case the corresponding key is not found in the configuration file.

Additionally, the function handles replacement patterns for YouTube descriptions, titles, and thumbnail filenames. These patterns are loaded from the configuration file and inserted into Listbox widgets within the GUI, allowing users to manage text replacements dynamically.

If the configuration file does not exist, the function gracefully handles the `FileNotFoundError` exception by passing silently, ensuring that the application continues to run with default values.

This function is called during the initialization of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class, specifically in the `__init__` method, to ensure that user preferences and settings are applied as soon as the GUI is launched. The configuration file path is determined based on the user's home directory, and the function is executed immediately after the GUI frames and widgets are set up.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the configuration file (`youtube_bulk_upload_config.json`) is properly formatted as a valid JSON file to avoid parsing errors.
- If the configuration file is missing, the function will not raise an error but will instead use default values for all settings.
- Changes made to the configuration file while the application is running will not take effect until the application is restarted or the `load_gui_config_options` function is explicitly called again.
***
### FunctionDef save_gui_config_options(self)
**save_gui_config_options**: The function of save_gui_config_options is to save the current GUI configuration options to a file in JSON format.

**parameters**: The function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `save_gui_config_options` function is responsible for saving the current state of the GUI configuration to a file. It begins by logging an informational message indicating that the configuration values are being saved to the specified file path (`self.gui_config_filepath`). 

The function then retrieves replacement patterns for YouTube descriptions, titles, and thumbnail filenames by calling the `get_replacements` method from three different frames: `youtube_desc_frame`, `youtube_title_frame`, and `thumbnail_frame`. These replacement patterns are stored in variables `youtube_description_replacements`, `youtube_title_replacements`, and `thumbnail_filename_replacements`, respectively.

Next, the function constructs a dictionary named `config` that contains all the current configuration values. These values are retrieved from various GUI variables, such as `log_level_var`, `dry_run_var`, `noninteractive_var`, and others. The dictionary also includes the replacement patterns retrieved earlier.

Finally, the function writes the `config` dictionary to the file specified by `self.gui_config_filepath` in JSON format. The `json.dump` method is used to serialize the dictionary, and the `indent=4` argument ensures that the JSON file is formatted with an indentation of 4 spaces for better readability.

In the context of the project, this function is called by the `on_closing` method of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class. When the GUI window is closed, `on_closing` ensures that the current configuration is saved by calling `save_gui_config_options`. This ensures that any changes made by the user in the GUI are persisted and can be reloaded the next time the application is started.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the GUI variables (e.g., `log_level_var`, `dry_run_var`, etc.) have been properly initialized and contain valid values.
- The replacement patterns retrieved from the frames must be in the correct format, as expected by the `get_replacements` method.
- The file path specified by `self.gui_config_filepath` must be writable; otherwise, the function will raise an error when attempting to write the configuration file.
***
### FunctionDef on_log_level_change(self)
**on_log_level_change**: The function of on_log_level_change is to update the logging level of the application based on the user's selection from the GUI.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: This parameter allows the function to accept any number of positional arguments. It is used to handle the trace callback from the `log_level_var` variable, but the arguments themselves are not directly used within the function.

**Code Description**: The `on_log_level_change` function is a callback method that is triggered whenever the user changes the log level in the GUI. The function performs the following steps:
1. It logs the new log level selected by the user using the `logger.info` method, which outputs a message indicating the new log level.
2. It retrieves the selected log level as a string from the `log_level_var` variable, which is a `tk.StringVar` tied to the GUI's log level selection widget.
3. It converts the log level string to a corresponding logging module constant using the `getattr` function. If the specified log level string does not match any logging module constant, it defaults to `logging.DEBUG`.
4. Finally, it updates the logger's level to the new log level using the `setLevel` method, ensuring that the logger will now filter messages according to the selected severity level.

This function is called automatically whenever the `log_level_var` variable changes, as it is set up with a trace in the `__init__` method of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class. The trace mechanism ensures that any change in the GUI's log level selection is immediately reflected in the application's logging behavior.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the log level string provided by the GUI matches one of the standard logging level names (e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", etc.). If an invalid string is provided, the function will default to `logging.DEBUG`.
- This function is tightly coupled with the GUI's log level selection widget, so any changes to the widget's behavior or the log level options should be reflected in this function to ensure consistent behavior.

**Code Description**: 
The `set_window_icon` function is responsible for setting the application window icon to the YouTube Bulk Upload logo. It begins by logging an informational message indicating the start of the process. The function then constructs a list of potential file paths where the logo image might be located. These paths include both `.png` and `.ico` formats, and they are checked in the following order:
1. `logo.png` in the bundle directory.
2. `logo.png` in the `youtube_bulk_upload` subdirectory of the bundle directory.
3. `logo.ico` in the bundle directory.
4. `logo.ico` in the `youtube_bulk_upload` subdirectory of the bundle directory.

The function iterates through these file paths and checks if the file exists using `os.path.exists`. If a valid file is found, it logs the file path and sets the window icon accordingly. For `.ico` files, it uses the `iconbitmap` method of the `gui_root` (a `tk.Tk` instance). For `.png` files, it creates a `tk.PhotoImage` object and sets it as the window icon using the `wm_iconphoto` method. If no valid file is found after checking all paths, the function raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

If any exception occurs during the process, it is caught, and an error message is logged. This ensures that the application can continue running even if the icon cannot be set.

The function is called during the initialization of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class, specifically in the `__init__` method, to ensure that the application window displays the correct icon as soon as it is launched. This enhances the user experience by providing a recognizable visual identity for the application.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the logo files (`logo.png` or `logo.ico`) are placed in the correct directories as specified in the `icon_filepaths` list. If the files are missing or incorrectly placed, the function will fail to set the icon, and an error will be logged.
- The function assumes that the `bundle_dir` attribute is correctly set to the directory containing the application resources. This is typically handled during the initialization of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class.

### FunctionDef add_textbox_log_handler(self)
**add_textbox_log_handler**: The function of add_textbox_log_handler is to integrate a custom logging handler into the application's logger, enabling log messages to be displayed in a text widget within the GUI.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters. It operates on the instance attributes of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class.

**Code Description**: 
The `add_textbox_log_handler` method is responsible for configuring and adding a custom logging handler (`TextHandler`) to the application's logger. This handler directs log messages to a text widget in the GUI, providing real-time feedback to the user. The method performs the following steps:

1. **Log Initialization**: The method begins by logging an informational message indicating that the textbox log handler is being added. This ensures that the operation is traceable in the logs.

2. **Handler Creation**: An instance of `TextHandler` is created, passing the application's logger (`self.logger`) and the text widget (`self.log_output`) as arguments. The `TextHandler` is a custom logging handler designed to display log messages in a GUI text widget.

3. **Formatter Configuration**: A log formatter is created using `logging.Formatter`, specifying the format for log messages. The format includes the timestamp, log level, module name, and the log message itself. This formatter is then applied to the `TextHandler` instance using the `setFormatter` method.

4. **Handler Integration**: Finally, the `TextHandler` instance is added to the application's logger using the `addHandler` method. This ensures that all log messages processed by the logger are also displayed in the GUI text widget.

The `add_textbox_log_handler` method is called during the initialization of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class, specifically in the `__init__` method. This ensures that the logging functionality is set up as soon as the GUI is initialized, allowing log messages to be displayed in the GUI from the start of the application's execution.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `self.log_output` text widget is properly initialized before calling this method, as it is required by the `TextHandler`.
- The log formatter used in this method can be customized to suit specific logging needs, but care should be taken to ensure that the format remains clear and informative.
- The `TextHandler` toggles the text widget's state between `NORMAL` and `DISABLED` to allow updates while preventing user modifications. Avoid directly modifying the text widget outside of the `TextHandler` to maintain consistency.

### FunctionDef prompt_user_bool(self, prompt_message, allow_empty)
**prompt_user_bool**: The function of prompt_user_bool is to prompt the user for a boolean input via a GUI dialog in a thread-safe manner.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· prompt_message: The message to display in the dialog, which will be shown to the user to request a boolean input.
· allow_empty: This parameter is not used in the current implementation but is kept for compatibility purposes. It does not affect the behavior of the function.

**Code Description**: The function `prompt_user_bool` is designed to interact with the user through a graphical user interface (GUI) to obtain a boolean response. It uses the `messagebox.askyesno` method from the `tkinter` library to display a dialog box with a confirmation message. The function ensures thread safety by using an event-based mechanism to handle user input. 

The function begins by logging a debug message indicating that the user is being prompted for a boolean input. It then defines a nested function `prompt` that displays the dialog box and waits for the user's response. Once the user provides input, the result is stored in `self.user_input_result`, and an event (`self.user_input_event`) is set to signal that the input has been received. 

The function schedules the `prompt` function to run in the main GUI thread using `self.gui_root.after(0, prompt)`. This ensures that the GUI operations are performed in a thread-safe manner. The function immediately returns `None` after scheduling the prompt, as the actual user input will be handled asynchronously.

**Note**: The function does not block the main thread while waiting for user input. Instead, it relies on an event-based mechanism to handle the input asynchronously. Developers should ensure that the GUI event loop is running properly for this function to work as expected.

**Output Example**: The function returns `None` immediately after scheduling the prompt. The actual boolean input from the user (either `True` or `False`) will be stored in `self.user_input_result` once the user responds to the dialog. If the user cancels the dialog, the result will be `None`.
#### FunctionDef prompt
**prompt**: The function of prompt is to display a confirmation dialog to the user and store their response.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None: This function does not take any explicit parameters. It relies on the `prompt_message` variable, which is assumed to be defined in the class or context where this function is used.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The `prompt` function is designed to interact with the user by displaying a confirmation dialog using the `messagebox.askyesno` method from the `tkinter` library. The dialog presents a message (stored in `prompt_message`) and asks the user to confirm or deny the action by selecting "Yes" or "No". The user's response is stored in the `self.user_input_result` attribute of the class. After the user provides their input, the function signals that the input has been received by setting the `self.user_input_event` event. This event can be used to synchronize further actions in the program that depend on the user's response.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that `prompt_message` is properly defined and contains the message you want to display to the user before calling this function.
- The `self.user_input_event` event should be properly handled in the program to ensure that subsequent actions wait for the user's input.
- This function is blocking, meaning it will wait for the user to respond before proceeding with the rest of the program execution.

### FunctionDef prompt_user_text(self, prompt_message, default_response)
**prompt_user_text**: The function of prompt_user_text is to prompt the user for text input via a GUI dialog and return the entered text or None if the dialog is canceled.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· prompt_message: The message to display in the dialog, which informs the user about the expected input.
· default_response: The default text to display in the input box, providing a pre-filled value that the user can modify or accept.

**Code Description**: The function `prompt_user_text` is designed to interact with the user through a graphical user interface (GUI) to collect text input. It begins by logging a debug message indicating that the user is being prompted for text input. The function then defines a nested function `prompt`, which uses `simpledialog.askstring` to display a dialog box with the provided `prompt_message` and `default_response`. The dialog is parented to the main GUI window (`self.gui_root`), ensuring it appears as a modal dialog. Once the user provides input or cancels the dialog, the result is stored in `self.user_input_result`, and an event (`self.user_input_event`) is set to signal that the input has been received. The function schedules the `prompt` function to run immediately using `self.gui_root.after(0, prompt)` and returns `None` immediately, as the actual user input will be handled asynchronously.

**Note**: This function relies on the GUI event loop to handle user input asynchronously. The caller must wait for `self.user_input_event` to be set before accessing `self.user_input_result` to retrieve the user's input. If the dialog is canceled, `self.user_input_result` will be `None`.

**Output Example**: If the user enters "example text" in the dialog, the function will eventually set `self.user_input_result` to "example text". If the user cancels the dialog, `self.user_input_result` will be `None`.
#### FunctionDef prompt
**prompt**: The function of prompt is to display a dialog box that prompts the user to input text and stores the result in the `user_input_result` attribute, then signals that the input has been received.

**parameters**: The function does not explicitly take any parameters. However, it relies on the following attributes and variables from the class instance:
- `self.gui_root`: The parent window for the dialog box.
- `prompt_message`: The message displayed in the dialog box to prompt the user for input.
- `default_response`: The initial value displayed in the input field of the dialog box.
- `self.user_input_event`: An event object used to signal that the user has provided input.

**Code Description**: 
The `prompt` function uses the `simpledialog.askstring` method from the `tkinter` library to display a modal dialog box that prompts the user to enter text. The dialog box is displayed with the following properties:
- The title of the dialog box is "Input".
- The `prompt_message` is displayed as the prompt text inside the dialog box.
- The `self.gui_root` is set as the parent window, ensuring the dialog box is modal to the parent window.
- The `initialvalue` parameter is set to `default_response`, which pre-fills the input field with this value.

Once the user provides input and closes the dialog box, the entered text is stored in the `self.user_input_result` attribute. After storing the input, the function calls `self.user_input_event.set()` to signal that the user has completed the input process. This event can be used by other parts of the program to wait for or respond to the user's input.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.gui_root`, `prompt_message`, `default_response`, and `self.user_input_event` are properly initialized before calling this function.
- The function is blocking, meaning it will wait for the user to provide input before proceeding. Use this function in contexts where user input is required before continuing execution.

### FunctionDef update_progress(self, progress)
**update_progress**: The function of update_progress is to update the progress bar in the GUI and log the current progress.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· progress: A float value representing the current progress, typically ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no progress and 1 indicates completion.

**Code Description**: The `update_progress` function is designed to update the progress bar in the GUI and log the current progress. It takes a single parameter, `progress`, which is a float value representing the current progress. The function first logs the progress value using the `logger.info` method, which outputs the progress to the log for tracking purposes. The progress value is then multiplied by 100 and assigned to the `value` attribute of the `progress_bar` widget, effectively updating the visual representation of the progress bar in the GUI.

This function is called by the `run_upload` method within the same class, specifically when the `progress_callback_func` is invoked during the upload process. The `progress_callback_func` is passed as a callback function to the `YouTubeBulkUpload` class, which uses it to report the progress of the upload operation. This allows the GUI to remain responsive and provides real-time feedback to the user about the upload status.

**Note**: Ensure that the `progress` parameter passed to this function is within the range of 0 to 1, as the function multiplies this value by 100 to update the progress bar. Passing a value outside this range may result in incorrect progress bar behavior. Additionally, the function assumes that the `progress_bar` widget and `logger` are properly initialized and available within the class instance.
***
### FunctionDef run_upload(self)

**parameters**: The function does not take any external parameters. It uses instance variables and GUI inputs to gather necessary data for the upload process.

**Code Description**: 
The `run_upload` function is responsible for orchestrating the video upload process in the YouTube Bulk Uploader GUI. It begins by logging an informational message to indicate the start of the upload process. The function then clears the `stop_event` flag, ensuring that any previous stop requests are reset before starting a new upload.

Next, the function retrieves various user inputs from the GUI, such as:
- `dry_run`: A boolean flag indicating whether the upload should be simulated without actually uploading videos.
- `noninteractive`: A boolean flag to disable interactive prompts during the upload.
- `source_directory`: The directory containing the video files to be uploaded.
- `yt_client_secrets_file`: The path to the YouTube API client secrets file for authentication.
- `yt_category_id`: The YouTube category ID for the uploaded videos.
- `yt_keywords`: A list of keywords for YouTube video metadata.
- `yt_desc_template_file`: The path to a template file for YouTube video descriptions.
- `yt_title_prefix` and `yt_title_suffix`: Prefix and suffix for YouTube video titles.
- `thumb_file_prefix` and `thumb_file_suffix`: Prefix and suffix for thumbnail filenames.
- `thumb_file_extensions`: A list of file extensions for thumbnail images.
- `privacy_status`: The privacy status for uploaded videos (e.g., private, public, unlisted).

The function also retrieves replacement patterns for YouTube descriptions, titles, and thumbnail filenames using the `get_replacements` method from the respective frames (`youtube_desc_frame`, `youtube_title_frame`, and `thumbnail_frame`). These patterns are used to customize the metadata of the uploaded videos.

After collecting all necessary inputs, the function initializes an instance of the `YouTubeBulkUpload` class with the gathered parameters. This class handles the actual upload logic, including authentication, file processing, and metadata generation. The `YouTubeBulkUpload` instance is configured with a progress callback function (`update_progress`) to provide real-time feedback on the upload progress.

Finally, the function starts the upload process in a separate thread using the `threaded_upload` method. This ensures that the GUI remains responsive during the upload. The `threaded_upload` method handles the actual upload process, including error handling and displaying success or error messages upon completion.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all required inputs (e.g., source directory, client secrets file) are correctly configured in the GUI before calling this function.
- The use of a separate thread for the upload process prevents the GUI from freezing, but it also requires proper handling of thread synchronization and error reporting.
- The `stop_event` flag can be used to stop the upload process at any time, providing a way to cancel ongoing uploads.
- The `dry_run` option is useful for testing the upload process without actually uploading videos to YouTube.
***
### FunctionDef on_closing(self)
**on_closing**: The function of on_closing is to handle the clean shutdown of the YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI application, ensuring that the upload thread is stopped, configuration settings are saved, and the GUI window is properly destroyed.

**parameters**: The function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `on_closing` function is responsible for managing the shutdown process of the YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI application. When the user attempts to close the GUI window, this function is triggered to ensure a graceful exit. 

The function begins by logging an informational message indicating that the `on_closing` function has been called. It then sets the `stop_event` flag, which is used to signal the upload thread to stop processing. This is crucial for ensuring that any ongoing upload operations are terminated safely.

Next, the function calls `save_gui_config_options` to save the current GUI configuration options to a file. This ensures that any changes made by the user during the session are persisted and can be reloaded the next time the application is started. The `save_gui_config_options` function serializes various configuration values, including replacement patterns for YouTube descriptions, titles, and thumbnail filenames, and writes them to a JSON file.

After saving the configuration, the function checks if an upload thread is currently running. If an upload thread exists, it waits for the thread to finish by calling `join()` on the thread. This ensures that any ongoing upload operations are completed before the application shuts down. The function logs a debug message indicating that it is waiting for the upload thread to finish.

Once the upload thread has been successfully shut down, the function logs an informational message confirming the shutdown and proceeds to destroy the GUI window by calling `self.gui_root.destroy()`. This effectively closes the application.

In the context of the project, the `on_closing` function is called when the user requests to close the GUI window. This is set up in the `__init__` method of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class, where the `wm_protocol` method is used to bind the `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` event to the `on_closing` function. This ensures that the function is automatically invoked when the window's close button is clicked.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the `stop_event` and `upload_thread` attributes have been properly initialized and are in a valid state.
- The `save_gui_config_options` function must be able to write to the specified configuration file path without errors.
- The function is designed to wait for the upload thread to finish, which may cause a delay in closing the application if an upload is in progress.

**Code Description**: 
The `threaded_upload` method is designed to execute the video upload process in a non-blocking manner, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive during the upload. It starts by logging a debug message indicating the beginning of the upload process. The method then attempts to call the `process` method of the `youtube_bulk_upload` object, which handles the actual video upload logic. If the upload is successful, it retrieves the list of uploaded videos and constructs a success message indicating the number of videos uploaded. This message is then displayed in the GUI using the `messagebox.showinfo` method.

In case an exception occurs during the upload process, the method catches the exception, logs the error message, and displays an error dialog in the GUI using `messagebox.showerror`. The use of `self.gui_root.after(0, ...)` ensures that the GUI updates (such as displaying messages) are performed on the main thread, avoiding potential threading issues.

This method is called by the `run_upload` method, which initializes the `YouTubeBulkUpload` class with parameters collected from the GUI and starts the `threaded_upload` method in a separate thread. This separation of concerns allows the GUI to remain responsive while the upload process runs in the background.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `youtube_bulk_upload` object is properly initialized before calling this method, as it relies on the `process` method of this object to perform the upload.
- The use of `self.gui_root.after(0, ...)` is critical for updating the GUI from a separate thread, as direct GUI updates from non-main threads can lead to instability or crashes.
- Proper error handling and logging are implemented to provide feedback in case of failures, making it easier to diagnose issues during the upload process.

The `add_find_replace_widgets` method creates a label, a listbox with a scrollbar for displaying active find/replace pairs, entry fields for inputting find and replace text, and buttons for adding or removing pairs. Tooltips are added to provide additional context for each widget.

The `add_replacement` method inserts a new find/replace pair into the listbox, while the `remove_replacement` method deletes the selected pair. The `get_replacements` method retrieves all active find/replace pairs from the listbox and returns them as a list of tuples.

In the project, `ReusableWidgetFrame` is used extensively in the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class to create frames for general options, YouTube title options, thumbnail options, and description options. Each frame is configured with specific widgets and find/replace functionality, demonstrating the reusability and modularity of the `ReusableWidgetFrame` class.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the logger provided during initialization is properly configured to capture debug messages.
- The `add_find_replace_widgets` method assumes that the input text supports regex syntax for advanced patterns. Users should be aware of this when entering find/replace text.
- The `get_replacements` method splits listbox items using the " -> " delimiter. Ensure that this format is maintained when adding replacements.

**Output Example**: 
The `get_replacements` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the find text and its corresponding replacement text. For example:
```python
[("example1", "replacement1"), ("example2", "replacement2")]
```
This output represents the active find/replace pairs stored in the listbox.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, parent, logger, title)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the ReusableWidgetFrame class, setting up the necessary attributes and configurations for the frame.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parent: The parent widget to which this frame will be attached.
· logger: A logger object used for logging debug and other informational messages.
· title: A string representing the title of the frame.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to configure the frame.

**Code Description**: 
The __init__ method initializes the ReusableWidgetFrame instance. It starts by assigning the provided logger to the instance variable `self.logger` and logs a debug message indicating the initialization of the frame with the given title. 

The method then sets default values for the padding on the x-axis (`padx`) and y-axis (`pady`) if these values are not provided in the `kwargs`. These defaults ensure that the frame has a consistent padding around its edges.

The `super().__init__` call initializes the parent class (likely a tkinter Frame or LabelFrame) with the provided parent widget, title, and any additional keyword arguments. This sets up the basic structure of the frame.

Two instance variables, `self.find_var` and `self.replace_var`, are created as `tk.StringVar()` objects. These are typically used to store and manage string values in Tkinter widgets, such as Entry or Label widgets.

Finally, the `self.row` variable is initialized to 0. This variable is used to keep track of the next available row index when adding widgets to the frame, ensuring that widgets are placed in the correct order.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `logger` object passed to this method is properly configured to handle debug messages, as the method logs initialization details.
- The default padding values (`padx=10`, `pady=10`) can be overridden by providing different values in the `kwargs` when initializing the frame.
- The `self.row` variable is crucial for managing the layout of widgets within the frame, so it should be incremented appropriately when adding new widgets.
***
### FunctionDef new_row(self)
**new_row**: The function of new_row is to increment the row counter by 1, allowing for the addition of a new row in the ReusableWidgetFrame.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `new_row` function is a simple utility method designed to increment the internal row counter (`self.row`) by 1. This is typically used in a GUI context where widgets are arranged in a grid layout. By calling `new_row`, the frame can dynamically add new widgets to the next available row in the grid. The function also logs a debug message using the `self.logger` object to indicate that a new row is being added, which can be useful for debugging purposes.

In the context of the project, `new_row` is called multiple times within the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class methods such as `add_general_options_widgets`, `add_youtube_title_widgets`, `add_youtube_description_widgets`, and `add_thumbnail_options_widgets`. Each of these methods is responsible for adding a set of related widgets to the GUI. After adding a group of widgets to a specific row, `new_row` is called to move to the next row, ensuring that subsequent widgets are placed in the correct position without overlapping or misalignment.

**Note**: This function is essential for maintaining the correct layout of widgets in the GUI. Developers should ensure that `new_row` is called at the appropriate times to avoid layout issues. Additionally, the debug logging can be helpful for tracking the flow of widget additions during development or troubleshooting.
***
### FunctionDef add_widgets(self, widgets)
**add_widgets**: The function of add_widgets is to dynamically add a list of widgets to the current frame in a grid layout, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· widgets: A list of widget objects that need to be added to the frame. Each widget in the list will be placed in the grid layout sequentially.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The `add_widgets` function takes a list of widgets as input and arranges them in a grid layout within the frame. The function starts by logging a debug message indicating the widgets being added. It then iterates over each widget in the list and places it in the grid using the `grid` method. The widgets are positioned in a single column (column 0) with a column span of 2, ensuring they stretch horizontally to fill the available space (`sticky="ew"`). Each widget is placed in a new row, with the row number incrementing after each widget is added. The widgets are also given padding on the x-axis (`padx=5`) and y-axis (`pady=2`) to ensure proper spacing between them.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the widgets passed to this function are compatible with the grid layout system.
- The `row` attribute of the frame is incremented after each widget is added, so the function assumes that the widgets will be added sequentially without any gaps in the row count.
- The function does not handle exceptions or errors related to widget placement, so it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the widgets are valid and can be placed in the grid.
***
### FunctionDef add_find_replace_widgets(self, label_text, summary_tooltip_text)
**add_find_replace_widgets**: The function of add_find_replace_widgets is to create and arrange GUI widgets for managing find/replace text patterns in a Tkinter-based application.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· label_text: A string that specifies the label text to be displayed above the find/replace widgets.
· summary_tooltip_text: A string that provides a tooltip description for the label, offering additional context or instructions to the user.

**Code Description**: 
The `add_find_replace_widgets` function is responsible for constructing a set of GUI components that allow users to define and manage find/replace text patterns. These patterns are typically used for text manipulation tasks, such as modifying video titles, descriptions, or filenames in bulk. The function begins by logging a debug message indicating the addition of these widgets, which helps in tracking the GUI setup process.

The function first creates a label using the provided `label_text` parameter. This label is positioned in the GUI using the `grid` method, with its row determined by the `self.row` attribute. A `Tooltip` is attached to the label, displaying the `summary_tooltip_text` when the user hovers over it. This provides users with a clear understanding of the purpose of the find/replace functionality.

Next, a `Listbox` widget is added to display the currently active find/replace pairs. This listbox is accompanied by a vertical scrollbar to handle cases where the list of pairs exceeds the visible area. The `Listbox` and scrollbar are positioned in the GUI using the `grid` method, with the `Listbox` spanning two columns to accommodate its width. A `Tooltip` is also attached to the `Listbox`, explaining its purpose to the user.

Below the `Listbox`, two `Entry` widgets are added for users to input the text to find and the replacement text. These entry fields are associated with the `self.find_var` and `self.replace_var` variables, respectively. `Tooltip` objects are attached to both entry fields to provide guidance on their usage, including support for regex syntax and advanced text manipulation techniques.

Finally, two buttons are added: "Add Replacement" and "Remove Selected". The "Add Replacement" button is linked to the `add_replacement` function, which inserts a new find/replace pair into the `Listbox`. The "Remove Selected" button is linked to the `remove_replacement` function, which removes the currently selected pair(s) from the `Listbox`. Both buttons are equipped with `Tooltip` objects to clarify their functionality.

This function is called in various parts of the project, such as in the `add_youtube_title_widgets`, `add_youtube_description_widgets`, and `add_thumbnail_options_widgets` methods, where find/replace functionality is required for modifying video titles, descriptions, and thumbnail filenames, respectively. The function integrates seamlessly with these methods, providing a consistent and user-friendly interface for text manipulation tasks.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `self.find_var` and `self.replace_var` variables are properly initialized before calling this function, as they are used to capture user input.
- The `Tooltip` class must be available in the project for the tooltips to function correctly.
- The `self.row` attribute should be managed appropriately to ensure proper widget placement in the GUI.
***
### FunctionDef add_replacement(self)
**add_replacement**: The function of add_replacement is to add a new find/replace pair to the list of replacements in the GUI.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `add_replacement` function is responsible for adding a new find/replace pair to the `replacements_listbox` in the GUI. It first retrieves the text entered in the `find_var` and `replace_var` variables, which represent the text to find and the text to replace it with, respectively. If the `find_text` is not empty, the function inserts a new entry into the `replacements_listbox` in the format `find_text -> replace_text`. After adding the entry, the function clears the `find_var` and `replace_var` variables by setting them to empty strings, effectively resetting the input fields for the next entry.

This function is typically called when the user clicks the "Add Replacement" button in the GUI, which is set up in the `add_find_replace_widgets` method. The `add_find_replace_widgets` method creates the necessary GUI components, including the input fields for the find and replace text, and the button that triggers the `add_replacement` function. The `add_replacement` function works in conjunction with these components to allow users to dynamically add find/replace pairs to the list, which can be used for text manipulation tasks.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `find_var` and `replace_var` variables are properly initialized before calling this function, as they are used to retrieve the input values.
- The function only adds a replacement if the `find_text` is not empty, so users must enter text in the "find" field for the function to work.
- The `replacements_listbox` must be initialized and properly configured in the GUI for this function to work correctly.
***
### FunctionDef remove_replacement(self)
**remove_replacement**: The function of remove_replacement is to remove selected find/replace pairs from the replacements listbox in the GUI.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `remove_replacement` function is designed to remove one or more selected find/replace pairs from the `replacements_listbox`, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) component. The function first logs a debug message indicating that the removal process is starting. It then retrieves the indices of the currently selected items in the `replacements_listbox` using the `curselection()` method. These indices represent the positions of the selected items in the listbox. 

To avoid issues with index shifting during deletion, the function iterates over the selected indices in reverse order using the `reversed()` function. For each index, it calls the `delete()` method on the `replacements_listbox` to remove the corresponding item. This ensures that the remaining items' indices are not affected by the deletions.

The function is typically called when the user clicks the "Remove Selected" button in the GUI, which is associated with this function via the `command` parameter in the button's configuration. This button is part of a set of widgets added by the `add_find_replace_widgets` method, which includes the `replacements_listbox`, entry fields for adding new find/replace pairs, and buttons for adding and removing pairs.

**Note**: Ensure that the `replacements_listbox` is properly initialized and populated before calling this function. The function assumes that the listbox contains items and that at least one item is selected when the function is invoked. If no items are selected, the function will not perform any deletions.
***
### FunctionDef get_replacements(self)
**get_replacements**: The function of get_replacements is to retrieve and parse replacement patterns from a listbox widget, returning them as a list of tuples.

**parameters**: The function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_replacements` function is designed to extract and process replacement patterns stored in a listbox widget. It begins by initializing an empty list called `replacements`. The function then retrieves all items from the listbox using the `get` method, which fetches items from index `0` to `tk.END` (the last item in the listbox). Each item in the listbox is expected to be a string formatted as `"find -> replace"`, where `find` represents the text to be replaced, and `replace` represents the replacement text.

The function iterates over each item in the listbox, splitting the string at the `" -> "` delimiter to separate the `find` and `replace` components. These components are then stored as a tuple `(find, replace)` and appended to the `replacements` list. Finally, the function returns the `replacements` list, which contains all the parsed replacement patterns.

In the context of the project, this function is called by the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class in two methods: `save_gui_config_options` and `run_upload`. In both cases, the function is used to retrieve replacement patterns for YouTube descriptions, titles, and thumbnail filenames. These patterns are then either saved to a configuration file or passed to the `YouTubeBulkUpload` class for processing during the upload operation. This ensures that the replacement patterns configured by the user are consistently applied across different parts of the application.

**Note**: 
- The listbox items must be formatted correctly as `"find -> replace"` for the function to work as intended. Any deviation from this format may result in errors or incorrect parsing.
- The function assumes that the listbox widget (`self.replacements_listbox`) has already been populated with valid replacement patterns.

**Output Example**: 
The function might return a list like the following:
```python
[("old_text1", "new_text1"), ("old_text2", "new_text2"), ("old_text3", "new_text3")]
```
This output represents a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of strings: the text to be replaced and its corresponding replacement text.
***
## ClassDef Tooltip
**Tooltip**: The function of Tooltip is to create and display a tooltip for a given widget when the user hovers over it.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· widget: The widget to which the tooltip is attached.
· text: The text content to be displayed in the tooltip.
· tooltip_window: A reference to the tooltip window that is created when the user hovers over the widget.

**Code Description**: 
The `Tooltip` class is designed to provide additional information to users when they hover over a specific widget in the GUI. It achieves this by creating a small pop-up window (tooltip) that displays the provided text. The class is initialized with two parameters: the widget to which the tooltip is attached and the text to be displayed in the tooltip.

The `__init__` method binds two events to the widget: `<Enter>` and `<Leave>`. When the user hovers over the widget (triggering the `<Enter>` event), the `enter` method is called. This method calculates the position of the widget on the screen and creates a `Toplevel` window to display the tooltip. The tooltip window is positioned slightly above the widget to ensure it is visible. The tooltip window is configured to be borderless (`wm_overrideredirect(True)`) and contains a `Label` widget that displays the provided text. The `Label` is styled with padding, a border, and a wrap length to ensure the text is readable and well-formatted.

When the user moves the cursor away from the widget (triggering the `<Leave>` event), the `leave` method is called. This method destroys the tooltip window, ensuring that the tooltip is only visible while the user is hovering over the widget.

In the project, the `Tooltip` class is used extensively in the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class to provide contextual help and explanations for various GUI elements. For example, tooltips are added to buttons like "Run," "Stop," "Clear Log," and "Reset YouTube Auth" to explain their functionality. Similarly, tooltips are used for labels and entry fields in the "General Options," "YouTube Title Options," "YouTube Description Options," and "Thumbnail Options" frames to guide users on how to use these features effectively.

**Note**: 
- The `Tooltip` class is designed to work with Tkinter widgets. Ensure that the widget passed to the `Tooltip` class is a valid Tkinter widget.
- The position of the tooltip is calculated based on the widget's position on the screen. If the widget's position changes dynamically, the tooltip may not appear in the correct location.
- The `y` coordinate adjustment (`y += 28`) in the `enter` method may need to be modified depending on the size and layout of the widgets in your application to ensure the tooltip is displayed correctly.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, widget, text)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Tooltip object and bind the necessary events to the widget for displaying and hiding the tooltip.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· widget: The widget to which the tooltip will be attached. This is typically a GUI element like a button or label.
· text: The text that will be displayed in the tooltip when the user hovers over the widget.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `Tooltip` class. It initializes the tooltip by associating it with a specific widget and setting the text that will be displayed. The method stores the widget and text as instance attributes (`self.widget` and `self.text`). Additionally, it initializes `self.tooltip_window` to `None`, which will later be used to store the reference to the tooltip window when it is created.

The method also binds two events to the widget:
1. `<Enter>`: This event is bound to the `enter` method, which will be triggered when the mouse pointer enters the widget. The `enter` method is responsible for creating and displaying the tooltip window.
2. `<Leave>`: This event is bound to the `leave` method, which will be triggered when the mouse pointer leaves the widget. The `leave` method is responsible for destroying the tooltip window, ensuring it is only visible when the mouse is over the widget.

By binding these events, the `__init__` method ensures that the tooltip is displayed and hidden automatically based on user interaction with the widget.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `widget` parameter is a valid GUI widget that supports event binding, such as a `Button` or `Label`.
- The `text` parameter should be a string that provides meaningful information to the user when they hover over the widget.
- The `enter` and `leave` methods are tightly coupled with the `__init__` method, as they are bound to the widget's events during initialization. Any changes to these methods should be carefully considered to maintain the expected behavior of the tooltip.
***
### FunctionDef enter(self, event)
**enter**: The function of enter is to display a tooltip window when the mouse pointer enters the associated widget.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· event: An optional parameter that represents the event triggering the function. It is typically used to handle mouse events but is not directly utilized in this function.

**Code Description**: 
The `enter` function is responsible for creating and displaying a tooltip window when the user hovers over a specific widget. The function first retrieves the widget's screen coordinates using `winfo_rootx()` and `winfo_rooty()`. These coordinates are adjusted to position the tooltip slightly above the widget, ensuring it does not overlap with the widget itself. The y-coordinate is incremented by 28 pixels to achieve this positioning, though this value can be adjusted as needed.

Once the coordinates are determined, a `Toplevel` window is created to serve as the tooltip. This window is configured to be borderless (`wm_overrideredirect(True)`) and is positioned at the calculated coordinates using `wm_geometry()`. Inside this window, a `Label` widget is created to display the tooltip text. The label is styled with padding, a border, and a green highlight color for visibility. The text is justified to the left, and the `wraplength` property ensures that long text is wrapped within a width of 350 pixels.

The `enter` function is automatically triggered when the mouse pointer enters the widget, as it is bound to the `<Enter>` event in the `__init__` method of the `Tooltip` class. This binding ensures that the tooltip is displayed whenever the user interacts with the widget.

**Note**: 
- The y-coordinate adjustment value (28 pixels) may need to be modified depending on the widget's size and the desired tooltip positioning.
- The tooltip window is designed to be borderless and positioned precisely, so it may not behave as expected if the widget's position changes dynamically. Ensure the widget's position is stable when the tooltip is displayed.
- The `wraplength` property of the label controls the text wrapping. Adjust this value if the tooltip text requires a different width for optimal display.
***
### FunctionDef leave(self, event)
**leave**: The function of leave is to destroy the tooltip window when the mouse pointer leaves the associated widget.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· event: An optional parameter that represents the event triggering the leave action. It is not actively used in the function but is included to handle potential event bindings.

**Code Description**: The `leave` function is responsible for managing the tooltip window when the mouse pointer exits the widget to which the tooltip is attached. When the function is called, it checks if the `tooltip_window` attribute exists. If it does, the function destroys the tooltip window using the `destroy()` method and sets the `tooltip_window` attribute to `None`, effectively removing the tooltip from the screen. This ensures that the tooltip is only displayed when the mouse is hovering over the widget and is promptly removed when the mouse leaves.

The `leave` function is bound to the `<Leave>` event of the widget during the initialization of the `Tooltip` class, as seen in the `__init__` method. This binding ensures that the `leave` function is automatically triggered whenever the mouse pointer exits the widget, providing a seamless user experience for tooltip management.

**Note**: Ensure that the `leave` function is properly bound to the widget's `<Leave>` event during initialization to guarantee that the tooltip is removed when the mouse pointer leaves the widget. Failure to bind this function correctly may result in tooltips persisting on the screen unnecessarily.
***
## ClassDef TextHandler
**TextHandler**: The function of TextHandler is to handle logging messages and display them in a text widget within a graphical user interface (GUI).

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· logger: A logging.Logger object used to log debug and informational messages.
· text_widget: A tkinter.Text widget where the log messages will be displayed.

**Code Description**: 
The TextHandler class is a custom logging handler that inherits from logging.Handler. It is designed to integrate logging functionality with a GUI by displaying log messages in a text widget. 

- The `__init__` method initializes the handler by accepting a logger object and a text widget as parameters. It logs a debug message indicating the initialization of the TextHandler and calls the parent class's `__init__` method to ensure proper setup of the logging handler. The text widget is stored as an instance variable for later use.

- The `emit` method is responsible for processing and displaying log records. It formats the log record into a string using the `format` method inherited from logging.Handler. The text widget is temporarily enabled for editing (`state=tk.NORMAL`), and the formatted log message is appended to the end of the text widget. The `see(tk.END)` method ensures that the text widget scrolls to the end, making the latest log message visible. Finally, the text widget is disabled again (`state=tk.DISABLED`) to prevent user modifications.

In the project, TextHandler is used by the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class to add a logging handler that directs log messages to a text widget in the GUI. This is achieved through the `add_textbox_log_handler` method, which creates an instance of TextHandler, sets a custom log formatter, and adds the handler to the logger. This integration allows log messages to be displayed in real-time within the GUI, enhancing the user experience by providing immediate feedback on the application's operations.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the text widget passed to TextHandler is properly initialized and configured within the GUI.
- The text widget's state is toggled between `NORMAL` and `DISABLED` to allow updates while preventing user edits. Avoid modifying the text widget directly outside of the TextHandler to maintain consistency.
- The log formatter used in conjunction with TextHandler should be carefully designed to ensure that log messages are clear and informative.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, logger, text_widget)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the TextHandler object by setting up the logger and text widget, and logging the initialization process.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· logger: A logger object used for logging debug and other messages during the initialization and operation of the TextHandler.
· text_widget: A widget object (typically a text-based UI component) that the TextHandler will interact with or manage.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The __init__ method is the constructor for the TextHandler class. It takes two parameters: `logger` and `text_widget`. Upon initialization, it assigns the provided `logger` to the instance variable `self.logger` and logs a debug message indicating that the TextHandler is being initialized. It then calls the `__init__` method of the superclass using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any necessary initialization from the parent class is performed. Finally, it assigns the provided `text_widget` to the instance variable `self.text_widget`, which will be used for further interactions within the class.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the `logger` object passed to this method is properly configured to handle debug messages, as the initialization process logs a debug message.
- The `text_widget` should be a compatible widget object that the TextHandler is designed to work with, as it will be used for text-related operations within the class.
***
### FunctionDef emit(self, record)
**emit**: The function of emit is to append a formatted log message to a text widget and ensure the widget scrolls to display the latest message.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· record: A log record object that contains the message and other logging information to be formatted and displayed.

**Code Description**: The emit function is responsible for handling log messages and displaying them in a text widget. Here is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:
1. The function starts by formatting the log record into a string message using the `format` method. This ensures the log message is properly structured according to the logging configuration.
2. The text widget's state is temporarily set to `tk.NORMAL` to allow editing. This is necessary because the widget might be in a disabled state to prevent user modifications.
3. The formatted message is appended to the end of the text widget using the `insert` method, followed by a newline character to ensure proper separation between log entries.
4. The `see` method is called with `tk.END` as an argument to automatically scroll the text widget to the end, ensuring the latest log message is visible.
5. Finally, the text widget's state is set back to `tk.DISABLED` to prevent further user edits, maintaining the widget's read-only nature.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes the text widget (`self.text_widget`) is properly initialized and configured before being used.
- The function is designed to work within a logging framework, where `record` is passed as part of the logging process.
- Ensure the text widget is not modified by other parts of the code while this function is executing to avoid unexpected behavior.
***
## ClassDef DualLogger
**DualLogger**: The function of DualLogger is to log messages simultaneously to both a file and a console stream, ensuring thread-safe operations.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· `_lock`: A class-level threading lock shared by all instances to ensure thread-safe logging operations.
· `file`: A file object opened in append mode, used to write log messages to a file.
· `stream`: A stream object (e.g., `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`) used to write log messages to the console.

**Code Description**: 
The `DualLogger` class is designed to handle logging operations that write messages to both a file and a console stream concurrently. This is particularly useful in scenarios where logs need to be displayed in a graphical user interface (GUI) while also being saved to a file for later reference. The class ensures thread safety by using a class-level lock (`_lock`), which prevents multiple threads from writing to the file or stream simultaneously, avoiding potential data corruption or interleaved log messages.

The `__init__` method initializes the `DualLogger` instance by opening the specified log file in append mode. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is printed, and the `file` attribute is set to `None`. The `stream` attribute is assigned the provided stream object (e.g., `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`).

The `write` method is responsible for writing the log message to both the file and the stream. It uses the `_lock` to ensure that only one thread can execute the write operation at a time, preventing race conditions. After writing the message, the `flush` method is called to ensure that the message is immediately written to both the file and the stream.

The `flush` method flushes the buffers of both the file and the stream, ensuring that all data is written immediately. This is particularly important for real-time logging, where delays in writing logs could lead to missing critical information.

In the project, the `DualLogger` class is used in the `main` function of the `youtube_bulk_upload/gui.py` module. Here, `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are redirected to instances of `DualLogger`, allowing log messages to be written to both the console and a log file simultaneously. This setup ensures that log messages are displayed in the GUI and saved to a file for debugging and auditing purposes. The log file path is determined based on whether the application is running from a PyInstaller bundle or directly from the source code.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the file path provided to the `DualLogger` instance is valid and writable. If the file cannot be opened, logging to the file will be disabled, but logging to the stream will continue.
- The `DualLogger` class is thread-safe, but care should be taken when using multiple instances pointing to the same file to avoid potential conflicts or performance issues.
- The `flush` method is called after every write operation to ensure that log messages are immediately written to both the file and the stream. This may impact performance in high-frequency logging scenarios.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, file_path, stream)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the DualLogger object by setting up a file for logging and storing a stream object for additional output.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_path: A string representing the path to the log file where the logs will be appended.
· stream: An object (typically a stream like sys.stdout or sys.stderr) that will be used for additional logging output.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function initializes the DualLogger object by attempting to open the specified log file in append mode. If the file is successfully opened, it is stored in the `self.file` attribute. If the file cannot be opened (e.g., due to permission issues or an invalid path), an error message is printed, and `self.file` is set to `None`. The `stream` parameter is stored in the `self.stream` attribute, which can be used later for additional logging output.

**Note**: Ensure that the `file_path` provided is valid and accessible, as failure to open the file will result in `self.file` being `None`, which may affect logging functionality. The `stream` object should be a valid stream (e.g., sys.stdout) to ensure proper logging output.
***
### FunctionDef write(self, message)
**write**: The function of write is to write a message to both the file and the stream associated with the DualLogger object, ensuring thread safety and immediate data flushing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: The message to be written to the file and/or stream. This is a string or any data that can be written to a file or stream.

**Code Description**: The `write` method is responsible for writing a given message to both the file and the stream, if they are available. It ensures thread safety by using a lock (`self._lock`) to prevent multiple threads from writing simultaneously, which could lead to data corruption or inconsistent log outputs. 

Inside the locked block, the method first checks if the `file` attribute is not `None`. If it is not, the message is written to the file. Similarly, it checks if the `stream` attribute is not `None`, and if so, the message is written to the stream. After writing the message to both the file and the stream, the method calls the `flush` method to ensure that the data is immediately written to the underlying file and stream, rather than being held in a buffer. This is particularly important in scenarios where real-time logging is required, such as debugging or monitoring.

The `flush` method, which is called within `write`, ensures that any buffered data is immediately written to the file and stream. This guarantees that the log messages are available for viewing or further processing without delay. The combination of thread safety, immediate writing, and flushing makes the `write` method reliable for logging in multi-threaded environments.

**Note**: This method should be used when you need to log messages in a thread-safe manner and ensure that the messages are immediately written to the file and stream. It is particularly useful in environments where real-time logging is critical, such as in debugging or monitoring applications.

### FunctionDef flush(self)
**flush**: The function of flush is to ensure that any buffered data is written to the underlying file and stream immediately.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `flush` method is responsible for flushing the data buffers of both the file and the stream associated with the `DualLogger` object. It checks if the `file` attribute is not `None` and calls the `flush` method on it, ensuring that any data written to the file is immediately written to disk. Similarly, it checks if the `stream` attribute is not `None` and calls the `flush` method on it, ensuring that any data written to the stream is immediately output. This method is crucial for ensuring that log messages are written in real-time, especially in scenarios where immediate logging is required, such as debugging or monitoring.

The `flush` method is called within the `write` method of the `DualLogger` class. After writing a message to both the file and the stream (if they are available), the `write` method calls `flush` to ensure that the message is immediately written and not held in a buffer. This guarantees that the log messages are available for viewing or further processing without delay.

**Note**: This method should be used when immediate writing of log data is necessary. It is particularly useful in multi-threaded environments where log messages need to be synchronized and written in real-time to avoid data loss or delays.

## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to initialize and launch the YouTube Bulk Uploader GUI application, setting up logging, handling PyInstaller bundle-specific configurations, and managing the application's main loop.

**parameters**: The function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `main` function serves as the entry point for the YouTube Bulk Uploader GUI application. It performs several critical tasks to ensure the application runs smoothly, including setting up logging, handling PyInstaller-specific configurations, and managing the application's main loop.

1. **Logging Setup**: 
   - The function first determines the appropriate log file path based on whether the application is running from a PyInstaller bundle or directly from the source code. If running from a PyInstaller bundle, the log file is saved in the user's home directory. Otherwise, it is saved in the application's directory.
   - The `DualLogger` class is used to redirect both `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to log messages simultaneously to both the console and the log file. This ensures that log messages are displayed in the GUI and saved to a file for debugging and auditing purposes.

2. **Logger Configuration**:
   - A logger instance is created and configured to log messages at the `DEBUG` level. The log messages are formatted to include the timestamp, log level, module name, and the message itself.
   - A console handler is added to the logger to ensure that log messages are also printed to the console.

3. **GUI Initialization**:
   - The function initializes the Tkinter GUI root object, which serves as the main window for the application.
   - An instance of the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class is created, passing the GUI root object, logger, bundle directory, and a flag indicating whether the application is running from a PyInstaller bundle.

4. **Main Loop Execution**:
   - The main loop of the Tkinter GUI is started using `gui_root.mainloop()`. This loop keeps the GUI responsive and handles user interactions.
   - If any exceptions occur during the execution of the main loop, they are caught and logged, and an error message is displayed to the user using a message box.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The function includes a try-except block to catch any exceptions that occur during the execution of the main loop. If an exception is caught, it is logged, and an error message is displayed to the user using a message box.

**Note**: 
- The `main` function is designed to handle both standalone execution and execution within a PyInstaller bundle. This flexibility ensures that the application can be distributed as a standalone executable without requiring modifications to the code.
- The use of `DualLogger` ensures that log messages are both displayed in the GUI and saved to a file, which is crucial for debugging and auditing purposes.
- The function assumes that the `YouTubeBulkUploaderGUI` class and `DualLogger` class are properly implemented and available in the project. Any changes to these classes may require corresponding adjustments to the `main` function.
