## FunctionDef clip_by_value(t, clip_value_min, clip_value_max, name)
**clip_by_value**: The function of clip_by_value is to clip tensor values to a specified minimum and maximum range.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A `Tensor` or `IndexedSlices` whose values will be clipped.
· clip_value_min: The minimum value to clip to. This can be a scalar `Tensor` or one that is broadcastable to the shape of `t`.
· clip_value_max: The maximum value to clip to. This can be a scalar `Tensor` or one that is broadcastable to the shape of `t`.
· name: An optional name for the operation.

**Code Description**: 
The `clip_by_value` function takes a tensor `t` and clips its values to the range defined by `clip_value_min` and `clip_value_max`. Any values in `t` that are less than `clip_value_min` are set to `clip_value_min`, and any values greater than `clip_value_max` are set to `clip_value_max`. The function ensures that the shape of the clipped tensor is compatible with the original tensor to prevent unintentional broadcasting. If `t` is an `IndexedSlices`, the function handles it appropriately by preserving the indices and dense shape.

The function first converts `t` to a tensor if it is an `IndexedSlices`. It then computes the minimum of the tensor values and `clip_value_max` to ensure no value exceeds `clip_value_max`. Next, it computes the maximum of the resulting tensor and `clip_value_min` to ensure no value falls below `clip_value_min`. The function asserts that the shape of the resulting tensor is compatible with the original tensor's shape. If the input `t` is an `IndexedSlices`, the function returns an `IndexedSlices` object with the clipped values, original indices, and dense shape.

**Note**: 
- `clip_value_min` must be less than or equal to `clip_value_max` for correct results.
- If the input tensor `t` is of type `int32` and the clipping values are of type `float32`, the function will raise a `TypeError`. In such cases, the input tensor should be cast to `float32` before clipping.
- Broadcasting is allowed, but it will fail if the clip tensors would expand the dimensions of `t`.

**Output Example**: 
For example, given a tensor `t` with values `[[-10., -1., 0.], [0., 2., 10.]]`, and clipping values `clip_value_min=-1` and `clip_value_max=1`, the output will be:
```
array([[-1., -1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  1.]], dtype=float32)
```
## FunctionDef _clip_by_value_grad(op, grad)
**_clip_by_value_grad**: The function of _clip_by_value_grad is to compute the gradients for the `clip_by_value` operation, which clips tensor values to a specified range.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· op: The operation object that contains the inputs and other attributes required for gradient computation.
· grad: The gradient tensor backpropagated from the subsequent operations.

**Code Description**: 
The `_clip_by_value_grad` function computes the gradients for the `clip_by_value` operation, which ensures that tensor values are clipped within a specified range defined by `y` (lower bound) and `z` (upper bound). The function performs the following steps:

1. **Input Extraction**: The function retrieves the inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` from the operation object `op`. These represent the original tensor, the lower bound, and the upper bound, respectively.

2. **Shape and Data Type Handling**: The shapes of `x`, `y`, and `z` are computed using `array_ops.shape`. The data type of the gradient `grad` is also stored for later use.

3. **Mask Creation**: Two masks are created:
   - `xymask`: A boolean mask indicating where the values of `x` are less than the lower bound `y`.
   - `xzmask`: A boolean mask indicating where the values of `x` are greater than the upper bound `z`.

4. **Broadcast Gradient Arguments**: The function computes the reduction indices for `y` and `z` using `gen_array_ops.broadcast_gradient_args` to handle broadcasting between the shapes of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

5. **Gradient Computation**:
   - `xgrad`: The gradient for `x` is computed by setting the gradient to zero where `x` is outside the bounds (i.e., where `xymask` or `xzmask` is true). Otherwise, the original gradient `grad` is used.
   - `ygrad`: The gradient for `y` is computed by setting the gradient to `grad` where `x` is less than `y` (i.e., where `xymask` is true). Otherwise, it is set to zero.
   - `zgrad`: The gradient for `z` is computed by setting the gradient to `grad` where `x` is greater than `z` (i.e., where `xzmask` is true). Otherwise, it is set to zero.

6. **Reduction and Reshaping**: The gradients for `y` and `z` are summed over their respective reduction indices and reshaped to match their original shapes.

7. **Return Values**: The function returns the computed gradients for `x`, `y`, and `z` as `xgrad`, `gy`, and `gz`, respectively.

**Note**: 
- This function is typically used internally by TensorFlow during backpropagation to compute gradients for the `clip_by_value` operation.
- Ensure that the input tensors `x`, `y`, and `z` are compatible in terms of broadcasting to avoid errors during gradient computation.

**Output Example**: 
The function returns a tuple of three tensors:
- `xgrad`: A tensor of the same shape as `x`, representing the gradient of `x`.
- `gy`: A tensor of the same shape as `y`, representing the gradient of `y`.
- `gz`: A tensor of the same shape as `z`, representing the gradient of `z`.

For example, if `x` is a tensor of shape `(3, 3)`, `y` is a scalar, and `z` is a scalar, the output might look like:
```python
(xgrad, gy, gz) = (
    [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
     [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
     [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]],
    0.5,
    0.8
)
```
## FunctionDef clip_by_norm(t, clip_norm, axes, name)
**clip_by_norm**: The function of clip_by_norm is to clip tensor values to a maximum L2-norm, ensuring that the L2-norm of the tensor does not exceed a specified value.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A `Tensor` or `IndexedSlices` of floating point type. This is the input tensor whose values will be clipped.
· clip_norm: A 0-D (scalar) `Tensor` greater than 0. This specifies the maximum allowable L2-norm for the tensor.
· axes: A 1-D (vector) `Tensor` of type int32. This parameter specifies the dimensions along which the L2-norm is computed. If `None`, the L2-norm is computed over all dimensions.
· name: An optional name for the operation.

**Code Description**: 
The `clip_by_norm` function normalizes the input tensor `t` such that its L2-norm is less than or equal to the specified `clip_norm`. If the L2-norm of `t` is already within the limit, the tensor is returned unchanged. Otherwise, the tensor values are scaled down proportionally to ensure the L2-norm of the output tensor equals `clip_norm`.

The function first converts the input tensor `t` to a standard tensor format if it is an `IndexedSlices`. It then calculates the L2-norm of the tensor along the specified axes. If the L2-norm is greater than zero, the function computes the safe L2-norm to avoid NaN gradients. The tensor values are then scaled by the ratio of `clip_norm` to the computed L2-norm. The function ensures that the shape of the intermediate tensor is compatible with the original tensor shape to prevent unintended broadcasting. Finally, the function returns the clipped tensor, preserving the structure if the input was an `IndexedSlices`.

**Note**: 
- The function is commonly used to clip gradients before applying them in optimization algorithms, preventing gradient explosion.
- The input tensor `t` must be of a floating point or complex type.
- The `clip_norm` parameter must be a scalar tensor greater than 0.

**Output Example**: 
For an input tensor `some_nums = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]], dtype=tf.float32)` and `clip_norm = 2.0`, the output might look like:
```
array([[0.26967996, 0.5393599 , 0.80903983, 1.0787199 , 1.3483998 ]],
      dtype=float32)
```
## FunctionDef global_norm(t_list, name)
**global_norm**: The function of global_norm is to compute the global norm of multiple tensors.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t_list: A tuple or list of mixed `Tensors`, `IndexedSlices`, or None. This parameter represents the collection of tensors for which the global norm is to be computed.
· name: A name for the operation (optional). This parameter allows the user to specify a name for the operation, which can be useful for debugging and visualization purposes.

**Code Description**: The `global_norm` function calculates the global norm of a list of tensors. The global norm is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared L2 norms of all the tensors in the list. The function first checks if `t_list` is a valid sequence (not a string) and raises a `TypeError` if it is not. It then processes each tensor in the list, converting `IndexedSlices` to dense tensors if necessary, and computes the L2 loss (half the squared L2 norm) for each tensor. These half-squared norms are summed up, and the global norm is obtained by taking the square root of twice this sum. The function returns a scalar tensor representing the global norm.

The `global_norm` function is primarily used by the `clip_by_global_norm` function, which clips the values of multiple tensors by the ratio of the sum of their norms. In this context, `global_norm` is called to compute the global norm of the tensors, which is then used to determine the scaling factor for clipping. This relationship is crucial for gradient clipping in machine learning models, where it helps prevent exploding gradients by scaling down the gradients when their norm exceeds a specified threshold.

**Note**: 
- The function ignores any `None` entries in `t_list`.
- The function assumes that the input tensors are compatible with the operations used to compute the L2 loss and the global norm.
- The function is designed to work with both dense tensors and `IndexedSlices`, making it versatile for different types of tensor representations.

**Output Example**: The function returns a scalar tensor of type `float`. For example, if the input tensors have a combined L2 norm of 4.0, the function will return a tensor with the value `2.8284271247461903` (which is the square root of 8.0, i.e., twice the sum of the squared L2 norms).
## FunctionDef clip_by_global_norm(t_list, clip_norm, use_norm, name)
**clip_by_global_norm**: The function of clip_by_global_norm is to clip the values of multiple tensors by the ratio of the sum of their norms.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t_list: A tuple or list of mixed `Tensors`, `IndexedSlices`, or None. This parameter represents the collection of tensors whose values will be clipped based on the global norm.
· clip_norm: A 0-D (scalar) `Tensor` greater than 0. This parameter specifies the maximum allowed norm for the tensors. If the global norm exceeds this value, the tensors will be scaled down proportionally.
· use_norm: A 0-D (scalar) `Tensor` of type `float` (optional). This parameter allows the user to provide a precomputed global norm. If not provided, the function will compute the global norm internally using the `global_norm` function.
· name: A name for the operation (optional). This parameter allows the user to specify a name for the operation, which can be useful for debugging and visualization purposes.

**Code Description**: The `clip_by_global_norm` function is designed to clip the values of multiple tensors based on their global norm. The global norm is computed as the square root of the sum of the squared L2 norms of all tensors in `t_list`. If the global norm exceeds the specified `clip_norm`, the tensors are scaled down by the ratio of `clip_norm` to the global norm. This ensures that the combined norm of the tensors does not exceed the specified threshold.

The function first checks if `t_list` is a valid sequence (not a string) and raises a `TypeError` if it is not. If `use_norm` is not provided, the function computes the global norm using the `global_norm` function. The scaling factor for clipping is then calculated as the minimum of `1.0 / use_norm` and `1.0 / clip_norm`, ensuring that the tensors are scaled appropriately. If `use_norm` is infinite or NaN, the scaling factor is set to NaN, which will result in the tensors being set to NaN to signal an error.

The function processes each tensor in `t_list`, converting `IndexedSlices` to dense tensors if necessary, and applies the scaling factor to each tensor. The clipped tensors are then returned along with the global norm.

This function is particularly useful in machine learning for gradient clipping, where it helps prevent exploding gradients by scaling down the gradients when their norm exceeds a specified threshold. It is slower than `clip_by_norm` because it requires all parameters to be ready before the clipping operation can be performed.

**Note**: 
- The function ignores any `None` entries in `t_list`.
- If `clip_norm` is greater than the global norm, the tensors remain unchanged.
- If the global norm is infinite, the tensors are set to NaN to indicate an error.
- The function works with both dense tensors and `IndexedSlices`.

**Output Example**: The function returns a tuple containing two elements:
1. A list of clipped tensors, where each tensor has been scaled by the ratio of `clip_norm` to the global norm.
2. A scalar tensor representing the global norm.

For example, if the input tensors have a global norm of 5.0 and `clip_norm` is set to 2.0, the function will return a list of tensors scaled by a factor of 0.4 (2.0 / 5.0) and a scalar tensor with the value 5.0.
## FunctionDef clip_by_average_norm(t, clip_norm, name)
**clip_by_average_norm**: The function of clip_by_average_norm is to clip tensor values to ensure that their average L2-norm does not exceed a specified maximum value.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A `Tensor` whose values need to be clipped. This is the input tensor that will be normalized based on the average L2-norm.
· clip_norm: A 0-D (scalar) `Tensor` greater than 0. This specifies the maximum allowed average L2-norm for the tensor values.
· name: An optional name for the operation. If provided, it will be used as the name scope for the operation.

**Code Description**: The function `clip_by_average_norm` ensures that the average L2-norm of the input tensor `t` does not exceed the specified `clip_norm`. It achieves this by first calculating the L2-norm of the tensor. If the average L2-norm of the tensor is already less than or equal to `clip_norm`, the tensor remains unchanged. However, if the average L2-norm exceeds `clip_norm`, the tensor values are scaled down proportionally so that the average L2-norm of the resulting tensor equals `clip_norm`.

The function internally performs the following steps:
1. Converts the input tensor `t` to a TensorFlow tensor if it is not already one.
2. Calculates the number of elements in the tensor and converts it to a float32 value.
3. Computes the inverse of the L2-norm for each element in the tensor.
4. Scales the tensor values by the minimum of two values: the product of the inverse L2-norm and the number of elements, or the inverse of `clip_norm`.
5. Returns the clipped tensor with the same shape and type as the input tensor.

This function is particularly useful in machine learning applications, such as gradient clipping, where it is necessary to prevent gradients from becoming too large during optimization.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input tensor `t` and `clip_norm` are valid and compatible for the operations performed. The `clip_norm` must be a positive scalar value. If the tensor is already within the desired norm, no changes are made to it.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `t` has values that result in an average L2-norm greater than `clip_norm`, the output will be a tensor of the same shape and type as `t`, but with values scaled down such that the average L2-norm equals `clip_norm`. For example, if `t` is `[3.0, 4.0]` and `clip_norm` is `2.0`, the output might be `[1.2, 1.6]` (values are illustrative and depend on the exact calculation).
