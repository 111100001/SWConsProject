## ClassDef Order
**Order**: The function of Order is to represent an order entity in a database, storing details such as the customer's name, order date, and associated order items.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· order_id: A unique identifier for the order, serving as the primary key in the database table.
· customer_name: The name of the customer who placed the order. This field is mandatory and cannot be null.
· order_date: The date and time when the order was placed. It defaults to the current date and time if not specified.
· order_items: A relationship attribute that links the order to its associated order items. It supports cascading operations, ensuring that all related order items are deleted if the order is deleted.

**Code Description**: The Order class is a SQLAlchemy model that maps to a database table named "order". It inherits from a Base class, which is typically the declarative base used in SQLAlchemy for defining database models. The class includes four main attributes:
1. `order_id`: An integer column that uniquely identifies each order. It is marked as the primary key.
2. `customer_name`: A string column that stores the name of the customer. It is defined as non-nullable, meaning it must have a value.
3. `order_date`: A DateTime column that records the date and time of the order. It defaults to the current date and time using `datetime.now()` if no value is provided.
4. `order_items`: A relationship attribute that establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `OrderItem` class. The `cascade="all, delete-orphan"` option ensures that all related `OrderItem` records are deleted if the parent `Order` is deleted. The `backref="order"` option creates a reverse reference from `OrderItem` back to `Order`.

The class also includes an `__init__` method that initializes the `customer_name` attribute when a new `Order` instance is created.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the `customer_name` is always provided, as it is a non-nullable field. Additionally, be cautious with the `order_items` relationship, as it will automatically delete related `OrderItem` records if the parent `Order` is deleted. This behavior is controlled by the `cascade` option.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, customer_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Order class with a customer name.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· customer_name: A string representing the name of the customer associated with the order.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is the constructor for the Order class. It takes one parameter, `customer_name`, which is used to initialize the instance attribute `self.customer_name`. This attribute stores the name of the customer who placed the order. When an instance of the Order class is created, this method is automatically called, and the provided `customer_name` is assigned to the instance's `customer_name` attribute.

**Note**: Ensure that the `customer_name` parameter is passed as a string when creating an instance of the Order class. This method does not perform any validation on the input, so it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the `customer_name` is in the correct format.

## ClassDef Item
**Item**: The function of Item is to represent a product or service in the system, storing its description and price.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· item_id: A unique identifier for the item, automatically generated as the primary key.
· description: A string that describes the item, with a maximum length of 30 characters. This field cannot be null.
· price: A floating-point number representing the price of the item. This field cannot be null.

**Code Description**: The Item class is a SQLAlchemy model that maps to the "item" table in the database. It has three columns: item_id, description, and price. The item_id is an auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key. The description is a required field that stores a brief description of the item, and the price is a required field that stores the cost of the item.

The class includes an __init__ method that allows for the creation of an Item instance by passing in a description and a price. The __repr__ method provides a string representation of the Item object, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes.

In the context of the project, the Item class is used in conjunction with the OrderItem class. The OrderItem class establishes a many-to-many relationship between orders and items, where each OrderItem instance links an order to an item and stores the price at which the item was sold in that order. The relationship is defined using SQLAlchemy's relationship function, which allows for easy querying and manipulation of related objects.

**Note**: When creating an Item instance, ensure that the description and price are provided, as these fields are non-nullable. Additionally, the price should be a valid floating-point number representing the cost of the item.

**Output Example**: An example of the string representation of an Item object might look like this: `Item('Widget A', 19.99)`. This indicates an item with the description "Widget A" and a price of 19.99.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, description, price)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the `Item` class with a description and a price.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· description: A string that represents the description of the item.
· price: A numeric value that represents the price of the item.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `Item` class. When an instance of the `Item` class is created, this method is automatically called to initialize the object with the provided `description` and `price`. The method assigns the `description` parameter to the instance attribute `self.description` and the `price` parameter to the instance attribute `self.price`. This ensures that each `Item` object has its own unique description and price attributes.

**Note**: Ensure that the `price` parameter is a numeric value (e.g., integer or float) to avoid potential errors in operations that involve calculations with the price. The `description` should be a string to accurately represent the item's details.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Item object that can be used to recreate the object.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: Refers to the instance of the Item class.

**Code Description**: The __repr__ method is a special method in Python that returns a string representation of an object. In this case, it returns a string in the format "Item(description, price)", where `description` and `price` are the attributes of the Item object. The `%r` format specifier is used to ensure that the values are represented in a way that can be safely used to recreate the object. This method is particularly useful for debugging and logging, as it provides a clear and unambiguous representation of the object.

**Note**: The __repr__ method should ideally return a string that, when passed to the `eval()` function, would recreate the object. This is not always possible or practical, but the returned string should at least be informative and unambiguous.

**Output Example**: If an Item object has a description of "Book" and a price of 19.99, the __repr__ method would return the string "Item('Book', 19.99)".
***
## ClassDef OrderItem
**OrderItem**: The function of OrderItem is to establish a many-to-many relationship between orders and items, linking an order to a specific item and storing the price at which the item was sold in that order.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· order_id: An integer that serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key of the "order" table. It is part of the composite primary key for the OrderItem table.
· item_id: An integer that serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key of the "item" table. It is part of the composite primary key for the OrderItem table.
· price: A floating-point number representing the price at which the item was sold in the order. This field cannot be null.

**Code Description**: The OrderItem class is a SQLAlchemy model that maps to the "orderitem" table in the database. It is designed to manage the relationship between orders and items, where each OrderItem instance represents a specific item sold in a specific order. The class uses a composite primary key consisting of `order_id` and `item_id`, which are foreign keys referencing the "order" and "item" tables, respectively.

The `price` attribute stores the price at which the item was sold in the order. This price can be explicitly provided during the creation of an OrderItem instance or default to the price of the associated item if not specified. The `item` attribute is a relationship to the `Item` class, allowing for easy access to the associated item's details. The relationship is configured with `lazy="joined"`, meaning that the associated item will be loaded eagerly when querying the OrderItem.

The `__init__` method allows for the creation of an OrderItem instance by passing in an `Item` object and an optional `price`. If the price is not provided, it defaults to the price of the associated item. This ensures that the price is always set, either explicitly or implicitly.

In the context of the project, the OrderItem class plays a crucial role in managing the many-to-many relationship between orders and items. It allows for the tracking of which items are included in which orders and at what price, facilitating order management and reporting.

**Note**: When creating an OrderItem instance, ensure that the `item` parameter is provided, as it is required to establish the relationship with the Item class. The `price` parameter is optional but will default to the price of the associated item if not provided. Additionally, the `order_id` and `item_id` must correspond to valid entries in the "order" and "item" tables, respectively, to maintain referential integrity.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, item, price)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the OrderItem class with an item and an optional price.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· item: The item to be associated with the OrderItem instance. This is a required parameter and represents the item being ordered.
· price: The price of the item. This is an optional parameter. If not provided, the price will default to the price of the item passed as the first parameter.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The __init__ method is the constructor for the OrderItem class. It takes two parameters: `item` and `price`. The `item` parameter is mandatory and is assigned directly to the instance attribute `self.item`. The `price` parameter is optional. If the `price` is not provided (i.e., it is `None`), the method assigns the price of the `item` (accessed via `item.price`) to the instance attribute `self.price`. If the `price` is provided, it is assigned directly to `self.price`. This ensures that the OrderItem instance always has a valid price, either explicitly provided or derived from the item itself.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
- Ensure that the `item` passed to the constructor has a `price` attribute if the `price` parameter is not provided. Otherwise, an AttributeError may occur.
- The `price` parameter is optional, but if provided, it will override the price of the `item`. This allows for flexibility in setting the price independently of the item's default price.
