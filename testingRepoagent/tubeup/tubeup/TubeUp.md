## ClassDef TubeUp
**TubeUp**: The function of TubeUp is to archive YouTube videos by downloading them and uploading them to archive.org.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· verbose: A boolean indicating whether to print all loggings to stdout.  
· dir_path: A string representing the path to the directory used for saving downloaded resources.  
· ia_config_path: A string representing the path to an Internet Archive configuration file used for uploading files.  
· output_template: A string template used to generate output filenames.  
· logger: A logging.Logger instance for logging messages.  
· output_template: A string that defines the output filename format for downloaded files.  

**Code Description**: The TubeUp class is designed to facilitate the archiving of YouTube videos by downloading them and subsequently uploading them to the Internet Archive. Upon initialization, the class accepts parameters that configure its behavior, such as verbosity for logging, the directory path for saving downloaded files, and the path to an Internet Archive configuration file. The class maintains a logger that can be set to different levels of verbosity based on the user's preference.

The class provides several methods to perform its core functionalities:
- `get_resource_basenames`: This method retrieves the base names of resources from a list of URLs. It utilizes the youtube-dl library to extract video information and checks if the items already exist in the Internet Archive.
- `upload_ia`: This method uploads a specified video to the Internet Archive, using metadata generated from the downloaded video. It ensures that only complete files are uploaded and handles the creation of necessary metadata.
- `archive_urls`: This method orchestrates the downloading and uploading process for a list of URLs, yielding the identifiers and metadata of the uploaded items.

The TubeUp class is called within the test suite located in `tests/test_tubeup.py`, specifically in the `TubeUpTests` class. Various test methods utilize the TubeUp class to validate its functionality, including setting up instances, testing attribute configurations, generating options for youtube-dl, and verifying the creation of metadata for uploads. These tests ensure that the TubeUp class behaves as expected under different scenarios, confirming its reliability and correctness.

**Note**: When using the TubeUp class, ensure that the specified directory for downloads exists or can be created, and that the Internet Archive configuration file is correctly set up to allow for successful uploads.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the `archive_urls` method could be:
```
:: Upload Finished. Item information:
Title: Mountain 3 - Video Background HD 1080p
Item URL: https://archive.org/details/youtube-6iRV8liah8A
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, verbose, dir_path, ia_config_path, output_template)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the TubeUp class with specified configurations.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· verbose: A boolean indicating whether to print all loggings to stdout. Default is False.
· dir_path: A string representing the path to the directory for saving downloaded resources. Default is '~/.tubeup'.
· ia_config_path: A string representing the path to an internetarchive configuration file used for uploading files.
· output_template: A string template used to generate output filenames. Default is None, which results in a standard template.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function serves as the constructor for the TubeUp class, setting up the initial state of an instance. It accepts four parameters that configure the behavior of the instance. The verbose parameter, when set to True, enables detailed logging output to the standard output, which is useful for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior. The dir_path parameter specifies the directory where downloaded resources will be stored, defaulting to a hidden directory in the user's home folder. The ia_config_path parameter allows users to specify a configuration file for the internetarchive, which is necessary for uploading files to the archive. The output_template parameter allows customization of the naming convention for output files; if not provided, it defaults to a template that includes the video ID and file extension.

Upon initialization, the function also sets up a logger for the class. If the verbose parameter is False, the logger's level is set to ERROR, meaning only error messages will be logged, thereby reducing the verbosity of the output. If the output_template is not specified, a default template is assigned to ensure that output filenames are generated in a consistent format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the specified dir_path exists and is writable, as this is where the downloaded resources will be saved. Additionally, users should provide a valid ia_config_path if they intend to upload files to the internetarchive, as failure to do so may result in errors during the upload process.
***
### FunctionDef dir_path(self)
**dir_path**: The function of dir_path is to return the value of the private attribute _dir_path.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The dir_path function is a simple accessor method that retrieves the value of the private attribute _dir_path from the instance of the class it belongs to. This function does not take any arguments and is called on an instance of the class. The purpose of this function is to provide a way to access the _dir_path attribute, which is likely intended to store a directory path relevant to the functionality of the class. By using this accessor method, the encapsulation principle is maintained, allowing controlled access to the internal state of the object.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the _dir_path attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning an undefined or unexpected value.

**Output Example**: If the _dir_path attribute is set to "/user/home/documents", calling the dir_path function would return the string "/user/home/documents".
***
### FunctionDef dir_path(self, dir_path)
**dir_path**: The function of dir_path is to set a directory for saving downloaded resources.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· dir_path: A string representing the path to the directory that will be used to save videos. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

**Code Description**: The dir_path function is responsible for configuring a specified directory as the location where downloaded resources, such as videos, will be stored. The function takes a single parameter, dir_path, which is expected to be a string indicating the desired directory path. 

Upon receiving the dir_path parameter, the function first expands any user directory shortcuts (like `~` for the home directory) using `os.path.expanduser()`. This ensures that the path is correctly interpreted regardless of the user's operating system.

Next, the function attempts to create the necessary directories for storing the downloaded resources. It constructs a path by joining the expanded user directory path with a predefined constant, DOWNLOAD_DIR_NAME, which represents the subdirectory where downloads will be saved. The `os.makedirs()` function is then called with the `exist_ok=True` argument, which allows the function to create the directory if it does not already exist without raising an error if it does.

Finally, the function assigns a dictionary to the instance variable `_dir_path`. This dictionary contains two keys: 'root', which holds the expanded user directory path, and 'downloads', which holds the full path to the downloads subdirectory. This structure allows for easy access to both the root directory and the specific downloads directory later in the code.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the provided dir_path is valid and accessible. If the path is incorrect or if there are permission issues, the directory creation may fail. Additionally, the DOWNLOAD_DIR_NAME constant should be defined elsewhere in the code for this function to work correctly.
***
### FunctionDef get_resource_basenames(self, urls, cookie_file, proxy_url, ydl_username, ydl_password, use_download_archive, ignore_existing_item)
**get_resource_basenames**: The function of get_resource_basenames is to retrieve the basenames of resources from a list of URLs using the youtube-dl library.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: A list of URLs that will be downloaded with youtube-dl.
· cookie_file: A cookie file for YoutubeDL.
· proxy_url: A proxy URL for YoutubeDL.
· ydl_username: Username that will be used to download the resources with youtube_dl.
· ydl_password: Password of the related username, will be used to download the resources with youtube_dl.
· use_download_archive: Record the video URL to the download archive. This will download only videos not listed in the archive file and record the IDs of all downloaded videos in it.
· ignore_existing_item: Ignores the check for existing items on archive.org.

**Code Description**: The get_resource_basenames function is designed to extract and return a set of basenames for videos that are downloaded from the provided URLs. The function begins by initializing an empty set called downloaded_files_basename to store the basenames of the downloaded files.

Within the function, several nested functions are defined to handle specific tasks. The check_if_ia_item_exists function checks if an item already exists on archive.org by retrieving its item name and checking its existence. If the item exists, it logs a message and returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The ydl_progress_each function processes each entry in the URL list. It checks if the entry is available and whether it is already recorded in the download archive. If the item does not exist on archive.org, it extracts information from the entry's webpage URL and updates the downloaded_files_basename set with the basenames created from the extracted information. If the item exists, it records the download in the archive.

The ydl_progress_hook function provides real-time feedback during the download process. It logs the progress, completion, and any errors encountered during the download.

The function then generates options for the youtube-dl library by calling generate_ydl_options, passing the necessary parameters including the progress hook. It uses these options to create a YoutubeDL instance and iterates through the provided URLs. For each URL, if ignore_existing_item is False, it extracts the information dictionary for the URL and processes it accordingly. If the URL is a playlist, it iterates through each entry; otherwise, it processes the single entry.

The downloaded basenames are logged for debugging purposes, and the function ultimately returns the set of downloaded file basenames.

This function is called by other methods within the TubeUp class, such as archive_urls, which utilizes the retrieved basenames to upload the downloaded videos to archive.org. Additionally, it is tested in the test_get_resource_basenames method, which verifies its functionality by comparing the actual output with the expected result.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible, as the function relies on the youtube-dl library to extract information and download the resources. Additionally, the parameters related to authentication and proxy settings should be correctly configured to avoid errors during the download process.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a set containing strings like:
{'KdsN9YhkDrY'} or 
{'Sample Video Title [abc123]', 'Another Video Title [xyz456]', ...}
#### FunctionDef check_if_ia_item_exists(infodict)
**check_if_ia_item_exists**: The function of check_if_ia_item_exists is to determine whether an item already exists in the Internet Archive based on the provided information dictionary.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: infodict - A dictionary containing information about the item, specifically the 'title' and 'webpage_url' keys, along with other metadata.

**Code Description**: The check_if_ia_item_exists function takes a single parameter, infodict, which is expected to be a dictionary that includes metadata about an item. The function first calls the get_itemname function to generate a sanitized identifier for the item using the information contained in infodict. This identifier is then used to query the Internet Archive through the internetarchive.get_item method.

If the item exists in the Internet Archive and the verbose mode is enabled (indicated by self.verbose being True), the function prints a message indicating that the item already exists and provides the title and video URL from the infodict. In this case, the function returns True, indicating that the item is already present and does not need to be downloaded again. If the item does not exist, the function returns False, indicating that the item can be processed further.

This function is called within the ydl_progress_each function, which is responsible for managing the download process of video entries. In ydl_progress_each, check_if_ia_item_exists is used to check if the item has already been downloaded before proceeding to extract information from the entry's webpage URL. If the item does not exist, the function continues with the download process; otherwise, it records the download in the archive.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the infodict passed to check_if_ia_item_exists contains the necessary keys ('title' and 'webpage_url') to avoid potential KeyError exceptions. Proper handling of these keys is crucial for the function to operate correctly.

**Output Example**: For an input dictionary like {'title': 'Sample Video', 'webpage_url': 'http://example.com/sample-video'}, if the item exists in the Internet Archive, the function would print the message indicating the item's existence and return True.
***
#### FunctionDef ydl_progress_each(entry)
**ydl_progress_each**: The function of ydl_progress_each is to manage the download process of video entries by checking their availability and recording their download status.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· entry: A dictionary containing information about the video entry, which includes keys such as 'webpage_url' and other metadata.

**Code Description**: The ydl_progress_each function is responsible for handling the progress of video downloads. It first checks if the provided entry is valid. If the entry is None or empty, it logs a warning message indicating that the video is not available and skips further processing. 

Next, the function checks if the entry is already present in the download archive by calling the ydl.in_download_archive method. If the entry is found in the archive, the function terminates early, as there is no need to download it again.

If the entry is not in the download archive, the function proceeds to verify whether the item exists in the Internet Archive by invoking the check_if_ia_item_exists function. This function takes the entry as an argument and checks for the existence of the item based on its metadata. If the item does not exist, ydl_progress_each calls ydl.extract_info with the entry's 'webpage_url' to extract the necessary information about the video. Following this, it updates the set of downloaded file basenames by calling the create_basenames_from_ydl_info_dict function, passing the ydl instance and the entry. This function generates a set of unique basenames from the extracted information.

If the item is found to exist in the Internet Archive, ydl_progress_each records the download in the archive by calling ydl.record_download_archive with the entry as an argument. This ensures that the download status is tracked for future reference.

Overall, ydl_progress_each coordinates the process of checking for existing downloads, extracting video information, and updating the download archive, ensuring that duplicate downloads are avoided and that the status of each entry is properly recorded.

**Note**: It is crucial that the entry passed to ydl_progress_each contains the necessary keys, particularly 'webpage_url', to avoid potential errors during the execution of the function. Proper validation of the entry is essential for the function to operate correctly.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value but may log messages indicating the status of the video download process, such as warnings for unavailable videos or confirmations of recorded downloads.
***

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· d: A dictionary containing the current status and relevant data about the download process.

**Code Description**: The ydl_progress_hook function is designed to monitor the progress of a download and provide updates to the user. It takes a single parameter, d, which is expected to be a dictionary containing various keys that indicate the current status of the download and other relevant information.

The function first checks if the status of the download is 'downloading' and if the verbose mode is enabled. If both conditions are met, it constructs a message template based on the available data in the dictionary. The message template varies depending on which keys are present in the dictionary:

- If '_total_bytes_str' is available, it indicates the total size of the download, and the message will include the percentage downloaded, total size, speed, and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
- If '_total_bytes_estimate_str' is available instead, it suggests that the total size is estimated, and the message will reflect that.
- If '_downloaded_bytes_str' is present, it will show the amount downloaded along with the speed and elapsed time if available.
- If none of these specific keys are present, a generic message will be constructed that includes the percentage, speed, and ETA.

The constructed message is then printed to the standard output, providing real-time feedback to the user about the download progress.

If the status indicates that the download is 'finished', the function logs a message indicating the successful download of the specified filename. It also logs the detailed information contained in the dictionary for debugging purposes. If verbose mode is enabled, it prints a confirmation message to the user.

In the case of an 'error' status, the function prepares an error message indicating that there was an issue during the download. This message is logged as an error, and if verbose mode is enabled, it is also printed to the user.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dictionary passed to this function contains the expected keys to avoid any KeyError exceptions. The function relies on the presence of specific keys to construct the output messages accurately. Additionally, the verbose mode should be managed appropriately to control the amount of output displayed to the user.

The license URL obtained from determine_licenseurl is included in the metadata dictionary returned by create_archive_org_metadata_from_youtubedl_meta. This integration ensures that the uploaded content is properly attributed with the correct licensing information, which is crucial for compliance with copyright and licensing regulations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the vid_meta dictionary contains a valid 'license' key with an appropriate value for the function to return a meaningful license URL. If the license is not recognized, the function will return an empty string, which may affect the completeness of the metadata.

**Output Example**: If the input vid_meta contains the following:
```python
vid_meta = {
    'license': 'Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)'
}
```
The function would return:
```
'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/'
```

### FunctionDef create_archive_org_metadata_from_youtubedl_meta(vid_meta)
**create_archive_org_metadata_from_youtubedl_meta**: The function of create_archive_org_metadata_from_youtubedl_meta is to generate a metadata dictionary suitable for uploading video content to archive.org based on YouTube-dl generated metadata.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· vid_meta: A dict containing YouTube-dl generated metadata about the video.

**Code Description**: The create_archive_org_metadata_from_youtubedl_meta function processes the metadata dictionary provided by YouTube-dl (vid_meta) to create a structured metadata dictionary that can be used with the internetarchive library for uploading content to archive.org. 

The function begins by extracting the title and webpage URL from the vid_meta dictionary. It then determines the collection type (either 'opensource_audio' or 'opensource_movies') by calling the TubeUp.determine_collection_type function, which analyzes the URL to ascertain its type.

Next, the function attempts to identify the uploader of the video. It checks for various keys in the vid_meta dictionary, such as 'creator', 'uploader', and 'uploader_url', to find the appropriate uploader name. If none of these keys provide a valid uploader, it defaults to using 'tubeup.py'.

The upload date is also extracted from vid_meta. If the 'upload_date' key is present and valid, it is converted to an ISO format. If not, the function defaults to the current date. 

The function constructs a tags string that includes the extractor key and any available categories or tags from vid_meta. It ensures that the resulting string does not exceed 255 bytes, as required by archive.org's subject field.

The license URL is determined by calling the TubeUp.determine_licenseurl function, which retrieves the appropriate license URL based on the metadata provided. 

The description of the video is processed to replace raw newlines with HTML line breaks, ensuring compatibility with archive.org's display requirements.

Finally, the function compiles all the gathered information into a metadata dictionary, which includes fields such as 'mediatype', 'creator', 'collection', 'title', 'description', 'date', 'year', 'subject', 'originalurl', and 'licenseurl'. It also includes a 'scanner' field to track uploads made by the TubeUp application.

This function is called by the upload_ia function within the TubeUp class, which handles the actual uploading of video files to archive.org. The metadata generated by create_archive_org_metadata_from_youtubedl_meta is crucial for ensuring that the uploaded content is correctly categorized and attributed.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the vid_meta dictionary contains valid keys and values, as the function relies on this data to generate accurate metadata. Missing or malformed data may lead to incomplete or incorrect metadata being returned.

**Output Example**: 
A possible return value from the function could look like this:
```python
{
    'mediatype': 'movies',
    'creator': 'Video Background',
    'collection': 'opensource_movies',
    'title': 'Mountain 3 - Video Background HD 1080p',
    'description': 'Mountain 3 - Video Background HD 1080p<br>If you use this video please put credits to my channel in description:<br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWpsozCMdAnfI16rZHQ9XDg<br>© Don\'t forget to SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, COMMENT and RATE. Hope you all enjoy!',
