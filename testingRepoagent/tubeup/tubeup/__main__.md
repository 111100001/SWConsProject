**Code Description**: The main function serves as the entry point for the TubeUp application. It begins by parsing command-line arguments using the docopt library, which interprets the command-line input based on the provided documentation string (__doc__). The parsed arguments include a list of URLs to be archived, optional parameters for cookies, proxy settings, user credentials, and various modes such as quiet and debug.

Once the arguments are parsed, the function checks if the debug mode is enabled. If so, it configures the logging settings to display detailed debug messages. This involves setting the logging level to DEBUG, creating a stream handler that outputs logs to standard output, and formatting the log messages to include timestamps and log levels.

The function then processes the metadata argument by converting it from a list of key-value pairs into a dictionary using the key_value_to_dict function. This transformation is crucial as it structures the metadata in a way that can be easily utilized by the TubeUp instance.

Next, an instance of the TubeUp class is created, with verbosity controlled by the quiet_mode parameter and an output template specified by the command-line arguments. The TubeUp class is responsible for downloading videos from YouTube and uploading them to archive.org.

The main function then enters a try-except block where it calls the archive_urls method of the TubeUp instance. This method handles the downloading and uploading of the specified URLs, yielding identifiers and metadata for each successfully uploaded item. After each upload, the function prints the title and URL of the uploaded item.

In the event of an exception during the archiving process, the function captures the error, prints a user-friendly message, and provides a traceback for debugging purposes. This ensures that users are informed of any issues that arise during execution, particularly those unrelated to connection problems.

Overall, the main function orchestrates the entire process of archiving URLs by coordinating user input, configuring logging, and managing interactions with the TubeUp class, which encapsulates the core functionality of the application.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the command-line arguments are correctly formatted and that the necessary dependencies, such as the docopt library and the TubeUp class, are properly installed and configured. Users should also be aware of the requirements for the Internet Archive configuration to facilitate successful uploads.
